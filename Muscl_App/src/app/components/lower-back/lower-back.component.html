        <ol>
            <li>Stance width can vary with a sumo DL. Some prefer toes near the plates. Others prefer a more narrow stance to get more drive off the floor.</li>
            <li> Make sure your arms are inside your legs. The bar should be just over your mid-foot. Flatten your back and push your heels into the floor.</li>
            <li> Try to extend your knees and hips simultaneously.</li>
